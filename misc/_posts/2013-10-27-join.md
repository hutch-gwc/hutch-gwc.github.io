*We are currently prioritizing a backend developer to improve databasing and compute for Nextstrain. [Click here for full job description](/blog/programmer-nextstrain-backend/).*

The lab is now close to capacity, but we're still taking applications from qualified applicants.  We place particular emphasis on evolution, epidemiology, virology and immunology, and especially their intersection.
