[Erik Volz](http://www.erikvolz.info/), [Katia Koelle](http://koellelab.weebly.com/) and I just had a paper published in PLoS Computational Biology reviewing [methods and applications in viral phylodynamics](/papers/volz-phylodynamics/).  This was part of PLoS Comp Biol's push for [Topics Pages](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002446).  These are reviews that get a full PLoS Comp Biol citation, but conform to Wikipedia format and standards with ample links to other Wiki pages, and at publication, they seed a new Wikipedia page.  The idea here is to give a CV incentive for researchers to contribute to Wikipedia, which would normally be seen as a time sink.  Plus this strategy gives the added benefit of increased exposure, as Wikipedia is often the first place people look when encountering a new subject.

The [PLoS Comp Biol version](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002947) is set in stone, while the [Wikipedia version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phylodynamics) is free to keep evolving as the field progresses, which feels quite comforting actually.
