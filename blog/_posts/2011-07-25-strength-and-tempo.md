I just had [a paper published online](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/220) in BMC Evolutionary Biology. 

This was a fun project.  It's essentially showing how the basic models of selection in population genetics play out in detailed phylogenies, where the passage of time is clearly evident.  I think a visual / phylogenetic approach really helps to understand the processes at work.  In this case, rather than describing an allele that reaches 100% frequency, the process of *fixation* describes a lineage that outcompetes its contemporaries and comes to be the progenitor of the entire future population.  A fundamental finding in population genetics is that selection reduces *effective population size*, that is when there is heritable variation for fitness, then the patterns of ancestry connecting individuals will resemble a smaller population.  Essentially, only a few fitter individuals have a chance of contributing their genetic legacy to the future population.  This paper explores the effects of selection on phylogeny shape, with particular attention to uncovering selective dynamics through time.
