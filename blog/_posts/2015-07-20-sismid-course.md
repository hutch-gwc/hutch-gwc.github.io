This week, [Sarah Cobey](http://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/) and I are co-teaching a short course on "Pathogen evolution, selection and immunity" for the 2015 [Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](http://sismid.uw.edu). This course is designed as an introduction to epidemiological modeling and evolutionary analysis for antigenically variable pathogens. Here, on the modeling side, we cover immune-mediated competition, multistrain mechanistic models and state-space reconstruction, while on the evolution side we cover the coalescent, phylogenetics and natural selection. We also discuss the immune response in terms of serology and B cell dynamics. I'm very excited about co-teaching this course.

Sarah and I have worked together to put all the course materials online. The course website is [here](/projects/sismid/). We include slide decks using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for individual topics like [competition](/projects/sismid/competition/slides.html) and the [coalescent](/projects/sismid/coalescent/slides.html). We also include introductory exercises for topics like [phylogenetics using BEAST](/projects/sismid/phylogenetics/practical/) and [state-space reconstruction](/projects/sismid/ssr/exercise/). The goal was to have something students could view alongside lectures, but also have something to refer to after the course was finished and to link out to follow-up material. Overall, I'm really quite pleased with this set up.
