title: Zika in the USVI genome announcement
author: Trevor Bedford
---

I've written before on the moral imperative for [timely data sharing of pathogen genome sequences during an outbreak](/blog/scientific-publishing-practices/).  With [Alli Black](/team/allison-black) and others from the lab and elsewhere, [we've been attempting our first sequencing work from Zika samples collected from the US Virgin Islands](/blog/sequencing-lab/). We have so far produced 11 Zika genomes. We have a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/blab/zika-seq) for the sequencing work with detailed experimental protocols and bioinformatic pipelines. We've also released a ["marker paper" on bioRxiv](/papers/black-zika-in-usvi) that spells out analyses that we intend to do with these data (in this case, an in-depth look at the USVI Zika outbreak). We've pushed all 11 genomes to [nextstrain.org/zika](http://nextstrain.org/zika).
