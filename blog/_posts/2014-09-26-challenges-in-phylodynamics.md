We've just had a review paper published in [Epidemics](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2014.09.001) outlining [eight challenges in phylodynamic inference](/papers/frost-challenges/) lead by [Simon Frost](http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/directory/sdf22@cam.ac.uk). This paper is part of an entire issue devoted to challenges in infectious disease dynamics that grew out of last year's [Isaac Newton Institute workshop](http://www.newton.ac.uk/event/IDD). Other interesting papers in the issue include challenges in [spatial epidemic models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436514000310) and challenges in [modeling emergence of novel pathogens](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436514000504).
