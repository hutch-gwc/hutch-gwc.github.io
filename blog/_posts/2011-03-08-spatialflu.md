I finally got the simulation code associated with the ["Global migration dynamics"](/papers/bedford-global-migration/) paper up and online.  Hopefully this will prove useful to other groups working on the evolutionary dynamics of viral pathogens.  Source code and analysis can be found [here](http://www.trevorbedford.com/spatialflu/).
