The lab is suddenly growing. We've had 4 new people join in the last ~2 weeks. [Allison Black](/team/allison-black/) is starting a UW Epidemiology PhD in the fall, [Gabe Erion](/team/gabe-erion/) is doing a summer rotation with the group as part of the UW MD/PhD program, [Charlton Callender](/team/charlton-callender/) is an undergraduate at the UW doing a summer research internship as part of the Fred Hutch SURP program and [Sidney Bell](/team/sidney-bell/) is starting a 1 year UW Epidemiology Master's adjunct to the MCB PhD program. This should be a fun summer with lots of projects to hack on together. I'm very much looking forward to it.
