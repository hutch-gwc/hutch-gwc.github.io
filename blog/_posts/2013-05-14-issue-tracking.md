title: Issue tracking reviewer criticisms

Last week, we got reviews back from [eLife](http://elife.elifesciences.org/) on the ["Integrating influenza antigenic dynamics..."](/blog/influenza-antigenic-dynamics/) paper.  Fairly positive, but as always, there are a number of issues that need correcting.  Mainly to help organize the process of responding to reviewer criticisms, I've tried to treat criticisms as "issues" that need fixing like bugs in a piece of code.  All the reviewer criticisms are now up as [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/trvrb/flux/issues).  As I work, I'm closing issues by linking to a commit that fixes the issue in the text, making it clear what, exactly, has been revised in the text in response to each criticism.

I'm convinced that issue tracking is a good model for the process of correcting particular scientific issues with a manuscript.  I could even imagine a manuscript publishing pipeline that gives reviewers the ability to create and close issues.  This would thread manuscript conversations by topic rather than exchanging long point-by-point response documents.
