About a week ago I gave an internet seminar on phylogenetics of the influenza virus over at [phyloseminar.org](http://phyloseminar.org).  I'm very happy someone stepped up to organize something like this (thanks Erick!).  You can [watch me talk to my computer for an hour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuS48h9k_qg) if you'd like, and the other seminars are really good as well.
