Conditionals
The computer can make decisions for you

Conditionals use data and true/false commands to make decisions for you. They are most often structured as if statements or if/else statements.

Whenever you make decisions in your life you are essentially doing what a computer does, but on a much higher level. Here are a few examples.

IF it is raining I will take my umbrella with me, ELSE I take my sunglasses with me.
If it is raining, this statement would be true and you would take your umbrella with you. If it is not raining, this statement would be false, and you would leave your umbrella at home.
IF it is after 5 pm I will go home, ELSE I will stay at work.
If it is 5:30 pm then this statement is true and you would leave work. If it is 4:59, this statement is false and you would stay.
Beware, structure is important in how you set up an if/else statement. I can easily invert it as follows: IF it is before 5pm I stay at work, ELSE I leave.
In this case, when it is 4:59 the statement is now true and you will stay at work.
