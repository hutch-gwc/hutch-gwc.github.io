Natalie is entering her senior year at Redmond High School. As a part of the [Fred Hutch High School Internship Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/careers/internship-opportunities/high-school-internship.html), Natalie joined the lab for 8 weeks in summer 2016 to learn about computational biology, viruses and phylogenetics. Through the internship, Eden performed a phylogenetic analysis of [chikungunya evolution](/projects/chikv/).
