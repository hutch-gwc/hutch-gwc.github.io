I am a new postdoc in the Bedford lab who will be using a combination of next-generation sequencing and phylogenetics to study the evolution and spread of RNA viruses. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in biology from Penn State University and my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the direction of [Thomas Friedrich](https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/friedrichlab/). My PhD work was focused on using Illumina sequence data to dissect the within-host evolution of influenza viruses, and to examine the role of transmission bottlenecks in viral cross-species transmission.
