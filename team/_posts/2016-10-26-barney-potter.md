I just joined the Bedford lab as a research assistant, where I am contributing to [nextstrain](http://nextstrain.org) and [nextflu](http://nextflu.org). Soon, I will also begin working on applying deep learning to try to predict flu success. I am interested in developing new algorithms that can efficiently reason with large amounts of sequence data.

I received my bachelor's from Reed College in Portland, Oregon where I majored in mathematics and biology. My undergraduate thesis was about extending the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem to directed hypergraphs, which I used to model dysregulations in cell signaling networks. I have also studied the effects of whole genome duplication in synthetic polyploid *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I plan on applying to graduate school to begin in Fall 2018, where I hope to pursue a PhD in computer science or computational biology.
