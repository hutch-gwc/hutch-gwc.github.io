title: Updating coaltrace to use Javascript

I've been trying to bring myself somewhat up to date with current web technologies.  I got my coalescent visualization [ported over](/projects/coaltrace/) to HTML5 / Javascript by using [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org).  If you're running Chrome or Safari, then this definitely makes for the better version.
