I did a [small write-up](http://www.trevorbedford.com/writeups/effective_parameters.html) on the scaling of the effective number of parameters in phylogenetic inference.  I was surprised by how nicely it worked out.  Basically, each additional taxa included in the model contributes one additional parameter.
