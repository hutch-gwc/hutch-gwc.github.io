title: LaTeX manuscript template with web display

I've spent a bit more time cleaning up my LaTeX template to make for fully automated web display.  You can find it [over on GitHub](https://github.com/trvrb/canalization). This is currently set up for the canalization paper, but it should make a good basis for any sort of scientific manuscript.  I've provided style sheets and a ruby script to cleanup output from TeX4ht into a presentable web version.  This web version is [hosted automatically through GitHub pages](http://trvrb.github.io/canalization/).  Thus, by running a single script, the LaTeX source is compiled to HTML and with a GitHub push you can update the public web version of the manuscript.  I hope this sort of approach will prove useful for collaborative writing.  

It was easy to run this on my previous manuscripts written in LaTeX.  I now have web versions of the [tree topology](http://www.trevorbedford.com/tree_topology/) and the [global migration dynamics](http://www.trevorbedford.com/migration_dynamics/) papers up.
