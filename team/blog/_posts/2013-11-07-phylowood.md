Last summer, I mentored [Michael Landis](http://www.michaeljameslandis.com/) as a [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) student.  He did a project developing a web visualization for phylogeographic and biographic analyses, looking at how phylogenies map to spatial locations.  He did a really great job implementing things with modern web technology, using [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/) to manipulate map tiles served from [Cloudmade](http://cloudmade.com/) and using [D3](http://d3js.org/) to manipulate graphics SVGs. The [Phylowood web application](http://mlandis.github.io/phylowood/) is hosted on GitHub and contains examples from influenza H5N1, rabies virus and the Vireya subgenus of rhododendrons.  Hosting this on GitHub should make it easy for someone to fork the entire repo and swap in their own examples for easy sharing of results.

We just had the [paper describing Phylowood](/papers/landis-phylowood/) published as an Application Note in Bioinformatics.
