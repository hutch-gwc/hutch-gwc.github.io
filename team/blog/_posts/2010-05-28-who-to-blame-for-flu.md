This is hilarious.  Of course it has to be someone's fault.  Wow.  

Ph.D. comics did a [piece on this](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174).  Fortunately, the articles produced by science writers were actually pretty good: [U of M News Service](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-05/uom-fdd052010.php), [HHMI News](http://www.hhmi.org/news/pascual20100527.html),  [CIDRAP News](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/general/news/may2710strains.html).
