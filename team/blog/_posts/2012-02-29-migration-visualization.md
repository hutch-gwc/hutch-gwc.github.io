I've put together a [visualization showing the global migration dynamics](http://www.trevorbedford.com/migration_dynamics/network.html) of the influenza virus.  Here, simulation parameters are based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis in the [2010 paper](/papers/bedford-global-migration/).  I've been using this in my talks for a while now.  Nice to finally get it online.
