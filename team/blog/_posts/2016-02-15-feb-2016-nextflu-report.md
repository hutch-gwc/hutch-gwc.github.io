[Richard Neher](https://neherlab.wordpress.com/) and I have compiled a [report on recent patterns of seasonal influenza virus evolution](http://nextflu.org/reports/feb-2016/) with projections for future clade behavior based on the [nextflu](http://nextflu.org) platform. This is designed to be looking forward to the 2016-2017 flu season. Lots of interesting behavior in H3N2 and H1N1pdm viruses. Within H3N2, the clade 3c2.a has continued to predominate throughout the last year and now genetic diversity is accumulating within 3c2.a. The issue is now watching for new variants within 3c2.a that may be antigenically distinct and thus spread through the virus population. H1N1pdm viruses have seen the rapid rise a novel clade denoted 6b.2 during 2015. This clade is demarcated by the substitutions 84N/162N/216T. The joint substitutions 162N/216T have risen especially rapidly with this season's Northern Hemisphere epidemic comprised of almost entirely 6b.2 viruses. However, detailed antigenic characterization is necessary to determine whether the seasonal influenza vaccine warrants updating.
