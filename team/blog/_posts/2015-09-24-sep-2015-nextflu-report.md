[Richard Neher](https://neherlab.wordpress.com/) and I have compiled a [report on recent patterns of seasonal influenza virus evolution](http://nextflu.org/reports/sep-2015/) with projections for future clade behavior. The [nextflu](http://nextflu.org) site made putting this together really straightforward. Lots of interesting stuff going on. The 3c2.a clade is taking over H3N2 viruses, there's a new clade of H1N1pdm viruses localized in South Asia and B viruses continue to oscillate between competing clades without permanent winners.
