I had the good fortune of working with [Flora Lichtman](https://twitter.com/flichtman) and [Sharon Shattuck](https://twitter.com/SharonShattuck1) at [Sweet Fern Productions](http://www.sweetfernproductions.com/) on a short science outreach video on the [different global circulation patterns of influenza A and B viruses](/blog/seasonal-influenza-circulation/). Sharon and Flora did the video as a sort of 50s educational short, which I think works beautifully. Many of the animations in the video are doctored screen grabs of my [coaltrace](/projects/coaltrace/) and [flutrace](/projects/flutrace/) animations. I also thought the pipe cleaners were pretty genius.
