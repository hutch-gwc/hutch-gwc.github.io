I am a PhD student in the [Department of Genomes Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/) at UW and a member of [Jesse Bloom's lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) at [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org/).

I study viral evolution. I try to figure out the "rules" viruses follow when they change over time.
